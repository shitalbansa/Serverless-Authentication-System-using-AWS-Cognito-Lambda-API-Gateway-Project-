ðŸš€ Project Explanation â€“ Serverless API with Authentication

ðŸ”µ. Project Name

ðŸ‘‰ Serverless API with Authentication using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito

Architecture Flow
User Authentication (Cognito):

End-users first sign up or log in using Amazon Cognito User Pool.
Cognito generates a JWT token (ID/Access token) after successful authentication.
API Gateway:

Users send requests (with JWT token in headers) to the Amazon API Gateway endpoint.
API Gateway verifies the token with Cognito Authorizer.
If valid, API Gateway forwards the request to the backend.
If invalid, request is rejected.
AWS Lambda Function:

API Gateway triggers your Lambda function.
Lambda executes your custom business logic (e.g., CRUD operations, fetching data, etc.).
Returns the response back to API Gateway.
Client Access:

The response is sent back to the authenticated userâ€™s application (web, mobile, or browser).
Key AWS Services Used
AWS Lambda â†’ Serverless compute to run your backend code.
Amazon API Gateway â†’ Acts as an API front door to securely expose Lambda.
Amazon Cognito â†’ Provides user authentication & token-based access.
CloudWatch Logs (optional) â†’ For monitoring Lambda execution.
Benefits
âœ… Serverless â†’ No servers to manage, fully managed services. âœ… Scalable â†’ Automatically scales with traffic. âœ… Secure â†’ Cognito ensures only authenticated users can access APIs. âœ… Cost-efficient â†’ Pay only for usage.

Use Case Example
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re building a Notes App:

Users register & login with Cognito.
After login, they get a JWT token.
The token is sent with requests to API Gateway (e.g., POST /notes, GET /notes).
API Gateway checks the token with Cognito.
Lambda stores or retrieves notes from a database (DynamoDB or RDS).
The response goes back securely to the user.
